particles that conform to an interesting vector image perhaps?

If you want to rotate in 3d remember the following:

In matrix notation instead of 𝑢′=𝑅𝑢 you need to calculate 𝑢′=𝑅(𝑢−𝑂𝑃)+𝑂𝑃, where

u is the vector to rotate
u’ is the rotated vector
R is the rotation matrix
OP is the vector from O to P (that is P-O)
